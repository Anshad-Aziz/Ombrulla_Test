[![Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rzgd7FZodsoyc4zEdRErhn09IC6f0JYP/view?usp=sharing)]
A Python application that integrates YOLO for object detection, LangChain with Groq's LLaMA3 model for text generation, and Streamlit for the user interface. The app accepts an image and a text prompt, detects objects in the image, and generates a coherent text response combining the analysis with the prompt.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Groq API key (sign up at [groq.com](https://groq.com))
